## Inline Image Store Eviction

- [ ] **Wire up user-configurable eviction for `inline_images.db`** — The Rust backend has the building blocks (`prune_to_size()`, `delete_unreferenced()`, `stats()`, `clear()`), but eviction is not yet exposed in the UI.

  **What's missing**:
  1. **Settings UI**: No user-facing control for inline image store size. The 128 MB cap is hardcoded in Rust.
  2. **Scheduled eviction**: No periodic sweep to catch edge cases (e.g., if `MAX_INLINE_STORE_BYTES` is lowered in a future update).

- [ ] **Make sidebar fixed-width (not resizable)** — The sidebar should be a fixed width, not draggable. Remove the sidebar resize divider and any sidebar width persistence from `WindowState`. The sidebar width is a constant in `layout.rs`, not a user preference.

- [ ] **Per-pane minimum resize limits** — PaneGrid currently uses a uniform `min_size(120)` for all panes. Should have per-pane minimums (e.g., sidebar can't go below 150px, thread list below 200px, contact sidebar below 180px). Requires clamping ratios in the `PaneResized` handler since PaneGrid only supports a single global minimum. Decide on actual values after visual testing.

- [ ] **Animated toggler widget** — Port libcosmic's slerp-based toggle animation for smooth sliding pill togglers. Current iced built-in toggler snaps instantly. libcosmic's version (`research/libcosmic/src/widget/toggler.rs`) uses `anim::slerp()` with configurable duration (200ms default), interpolating knob position per-frame via `RedrawRequested`. ~150-200 LOC to port.

- [ ] **`responsive` for adaptive layout** — Wrap PaneGrid in `iced::widget::responsive` to collapse panels at narrow window sizes (e.g., hide contact sidebar below 900px, stack sidebar over thread list below 600px).

- [ ] **Keybinding display and edit UI** — Need to redo the Settings/Shortcuts UI. Take a look at https://nyaa.place/blog/libadwaita-1-8/

- [ ] **UI freezes after ~20 minutes with settings open** — App hangs completely with no stdout/stderr. Prime suspect is the `mundy` subscription (`appearance.rs`) holding a D-Bus connection that may drop or block over time. Bisect by disabling subscriptions one-by-one to isolate.

- [ ] **License display/multiline static text row** — Need to be able to click links and make text selectable/copyable in license display widgets. Needs its own base row type.

- [ ] **Restore OS-based theme and 1.0 scale** — `SettingsState::default()` currently hardcodes `theme: "Light"` for development convenience. Revert to `theme: "System"` once UI prototyping is done, and persist user preferences to disk.

- [ ] **Wire up system font detection** — `crates/system-fonts/` is built and working (queries xdg-desktop-portal on Linux, SystemParametersInfo on Windows) but not wired into the app. Two phases:
  1. **UI font**: On startup, call `SystemFonts::detect().await`. If a UI font is found and it's available on the system, apply it via iced's `font::set_defaults` task. Fall back to bundled Inter if detection fails or font isn't installed. This just confirms/overrides the default app font.
  2. **Document font** (separate, later): The detected document font (e.g., TisaPro) should be used for email body text and other long-form content. This requires threading a separate font through the thread detail view and message body widgets. Not straightforward right now — email bodies are HTML processed by the sanitizer pipeline, not iced text widgets, so the document font may only apply once we have native body rendering. Add as a font setting in the settings UI too (let users override the detected system fonts).

- [ ] **Thread list keyboard navigation** — Arrow Up/Down to move selection, PgUp/PgDn to jump by a page, Home/End to jump to first/last. Should scroll the selected thread into view automatically. Enter to open thread, Escape to deselect. Needs an iced keyboard event subscription in the app, gated on the thread list having focus.

- [ ] **Scrollbars must shift layout, not overlay** — When a scrollbar appears (e.g., content grows beyond the viewport), it must push the content inward rather than overlaying existing UI elements. Overlay scrollbars cause text/buttons to be hidden behind the scrollbar track. Ensure all `scrollable` widgets use a mode that reserves space for the scrollbar or accounts for its width in the layout.

- [ ] **Thread list pagination (revisit later)** — Currently loads all threads at once (LIMIT 1000). This is fast with the test dataset (1000 threads renders instantly). We attempted batched lazy loading (200 per page, `on_scroll` trigger, spacer for honest scrollbar) but reverted: (1) `on_scroll` fires on every pixel of scroll movement, causing a full `update()`/`view()` cycle per pixel which made scrolling sluggish; (2) the spacer approach for honest scrollbar sizing made the content area huge, worsening the `on_scroll` overhead; (3) without the spacer the scrollbar thumb jumps when batches load (content height changes suddenly). The DB layer already supports `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` (`db.get_threads` has the params, `count_threads` exists). Revisit when thread counts actually cause problems — likely needs iced-level virtual scrolling (only render visible rows) rather than application-level pagination, since the bottleneck is widget count in the scrollable, not query speed.

## UI Specs Needed

- [ ] **Design Signatures UI** — Signature management lives in Settings. Needs spec for: creating/editing/deleting signatures, per-account default signature assignment, rich text editing (or HTML), signature insertion behavior in compose (new, reply, forward).

- [ ] **Design Emoji Picker** — Shared widget used in compose, calendar event descriptions, contact notes, and anywhere text input supports emoji. Needs spec for: searchable grid, categories/tabs, recent/frequent section, skin tone selection. Separate doc at `docs/emoji-picker/problem-statement.md`.

## Contacts Surface

- [ ] **Implement full contacts crate** — The current `seen-addresses` crate (643 lines, `crates/seen-addresses/`) only tracks sender addresses seen during sync. A proper contacts implementation needs: CardDAV sync (partially started in `core/src/carddav.rs`), contact search/autocomplete, contact detail views, contact groups/labels, merge/dedup, per-provider contact sync (Google People API, Microsoft Graph contacts, LDAP). When this lands, fold `seen-addresses` into the new contacts crate — it's the same domain and shares the same DB tables.

## Code Quality

- [ ] **Decide whether Graph `raw_size = 0` should stay accepted** — Graph still lacks a clean size field for the current query path. Either keep this as an accepted cosmetic limitation or document a better fallback if one exists.

## Microsoft Graph

- [ ] **Ship a default Microsoft OAuth client ID** — Register a multi-tenant Azure AD app ("Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"), set as public client (no client secret), configure `http://localhost` redirect URI, request Mail.ReadWrite/Mail.Send/etc. scopes. Ship the client ID as a constant in `oauth.rs`. Then remove the per-account credential UI (the "Update OAuth App" flow in settings that asks users for client_id/client_secret) — users should never see this. Keep the per-account `oauth_client_id` DB column as an optional override for enterprise users who need to use their own tenant-restricted app.

## JMAP

- [ ] **JMAP for Calendars** — `jmap-client` has no calendar support (upstream Issue #3). Blocked until `jmap-client` adds calendar types. Low priority — CalDAV covers calendar sync for now.

- [ ] **Investigate JSContact / JMAP for Contacts support** — Stalwart fully implements JSContact (RFC 9553) and JMAP for Contacts (RFC 9610) with bidirectional vCard conversion. Check whether our JMAP provider crate can use native JMAP Contacts instead of falling back to CardDAV. Audit current `jmap-client` crate for contacts types and determine what (if anything) needs to be added.

## IMAP

- [ ] **QRESYNC VANISHED parsing (Phase 3)** — Send `ENABLE QRESYNC` via raw command, then `SELECT mailbox (QRESYNC (<uidvalidity> <modseq> [<known-uids>]))`. Parse `VANISHED (EARLIER) <uid-set>` untagged responses. Blocked on async-imap CHANGEDSINCE support (Issue #130).
